## Description
Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table.
``` mysql
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return `200` as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return `null`.
``` mysql
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```
#### SQL Schema
``` mysql
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Salary int);
Truncate table Employee;
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('1', '100');
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('2', '200');
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('3', '300');
```
## Solution
``` mysql
SELECT
    MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM (
    SELECT
        Salary,maxSalary
    FROM Employee t1
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT
            MAX(Salary) AS maxSalary
        FROM Employee) t2
    ON t1.Salary = t2.maxSalary) t
WHERE
    maxSalary IS NULL
```

分页会产生一个问题
值相同，但是分页会强制产生一个值，此时应该为NULL
解决：去重
``` mysql
SELECT
    IFNULL(
        (SELECT DISTINCT Salary 
        FROM Employee 
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1,1),NULL
    ) AS SecondHighestSalary
```
